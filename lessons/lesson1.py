# Hello Isaiah!

# Section 1: The print() function
# print() is how you show stuff to the user.
print("Hello World")

# TODO: Try printing out your name below with the print() function!
print("Coson")

# TODO: Use the print() function to print out your favorite food below.
print("Sushi")

# TODO: Use the print() function to print out your favorite animal below.
print("panda")

# TODO: Try printing out your favorite number below with the print() function! Hint: You do not need quotations
print(6768494676)

# Section 2: Comments
# You can put hashtags in front of a line of code to make it a comment. Comments are ignored by the computer, so they are good for taking notes. To write a comment, put a hashtag # in front of the line of code you want to comment out. Commenting out code is also a good way to temporarily disable code that you don't want to run.


# TODO: Write a comment below talking about your favorite sport. Remember to start the line with a hashtag.
# hello my favorite sport is Fencing


# Section 3: Variables
# Variables are a name given to a value.
# To create a variable you write the variable's name, then the equal sign, then the value for that variable

favorite_animal = "Dog"
# Here, I create a variable named favorite_animal and assigned it a value of "Dog"
# We can see what the favorite_animal value is by using the print() function we learned earlier
print(favorite_animal)

# TODO: Create a variable named country and assign it a value of "America" below!
favorite_country = "America"
print(favorite_country)
# TODO: Create a variable named number and assign it a value of your favorite number below!


# Variables can be changed.

favorite_animal = "Bird"
# Here, I change the favorite_animal variable to "Bird"

# TODO: Change the favorite_country variable to "America"
favorite_country = "Hungary"
print(favorite_country)


# Section 4: Variable Names

# - Discriptive
# Make sure to name your variable something related to what that variable represents
# TODO: Which variable names do you think are better?
# 1
name = "John"
age = 30
favorite_food = "Turkey"

# versus
# 2
x = "John"
y = 30
z = "Turkey"

# - Case sensitive
# Variables are case sensitive. This means that if I create variables named dog, Dog, and DOG, they are three different variables.
dog = 'Oreo'
Dog = 'Mill'
DOG = 'JOJO'

# - Other rules for variable names
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
# A variable name cannot be any of Python's keywords or functions




# Section 5: Basic Data Types:
# In python, data types are the types of values.
# There are many data types, but we'll focus on three basic ones for now: integers, floats, strings.

# Integers:
# Integers are whole numbers. When writing an integer, you do not need quotations
# Example:
number = 50
# Here, we created a variable named number, and assigned it a value of 50. The data type of this variable is an integer.

x = 20

# Floats:
# Floats are decimal numbers. When writing an float, you do not need quotations
# Example:
float_number = 2.5
# Here, we created a variable named float_number, and assigned it a value of 2.5. The data type of this variable is an float.
y = 3.1415926



# String:
# Strings are words or letters. When writing an string, you do need quotations around it. The quotations can either be double quotes or single quotes.
# Example:
word = "helicopter"
# Here, we created a variable named word, and assigned it a value of "helicopter". The data type of this variable is an string.

z = "soup"

print(type(x))

# Section 6: Tracebacks
# When running the code, python reads from the top to the bottom. If there is an error in the code, it will give you a traceback. It will tell you what's wrong and you have to fix it.

prnt('Hello World')

# We're done!
